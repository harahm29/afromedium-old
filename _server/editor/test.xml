            <comment>Yandex (Russian: Yandex) is a Russian search engine and the largest Russian Web portal. Yandex was launched in 1997. Its name can be explained as "Yet Another iNDEXer" (yandex) or "Ÿ§ëª®¢®?© (language) Index". The Russian word "Ÿ" corresponds to English "I" (as the singular first-person pronoun), making "Ÿndex" a bilingual pun on "index".</comment>
